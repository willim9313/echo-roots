## Test Results

```bash
$ pytest tests/test_t3_fixed.py -v
================================================== 13 passed, 18 warnings in 0.26s ===================================================
```

All core functionality is validated through comprehensive test suite:
- ExtractorConfig creation and validation
- MockLLMClient realistic response generation
- IngestionItem model validation
- AttributeExtraction and SemanticTerm creation
- ExtractionResult with proper metadata
- Async operations and batch processing

## Usage Example

```python
from echo_roots.pipelines.extraction import ExtractionPipeline, ExtractorConfig
from echo_roots.pipelines.openai_client import MockLLMClient
from echo_roots.domain.loader import DomainPackLoader
from echo_roots.models.core import IngestionItem

# Load domain configuration
loader = DomainPackLoader("domains/")
domain_pack = loader.load_domain_pack("ecommerce")

# Configure extraction
config = ExtractorConfig(
    model_name="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.1,
    batch_size=10
)

# Initialize pipeline
client = MockLLMClient()  # or OpenAIClient() for production
pipeline = ExtractionPipeline(domain_pack, client, config)

# Process items
item = IngestionItem(
    item_id="product_123",
    title="iPhone 15 Pro",
    description="Latest smartphone with advanced camera",
    source="catalog_api"
)

# Extract attributes and terms
result = await pipeline.extract_single(item)
print(f"Extracted {len(result.attributes)} attributes")
print(f"Extracted {len(result.terms)} semantic terms")
```

## Architecture Compliance

The T3 implementation follows the echo-roots architecture principles:

‚úÖ **Protocol-based Design**: LLMClient protocol allows multiple implementations  
‚úÖ **Domain Pack Integration**: Full compatibility with T2 domain configurations  
‚úÖ **Model Validation**: Comprehensive Pydantic v2 model validation  
‚úÖ **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations for high throughput  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with retry logic  
‚úÖ **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with realistic mocking  
‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layer validation and quality scoring  

## Integration Points

### T1 Models Integration
- Direct processing of `IngestionItem` objects
- Outputs `ExtractionResult` objects with proper metadata
- Maintains `item_id` lineage throughout processing
- Compatible with existing T1 data schemas

### T2 Domain Pack Integration  
- Uses `DomainPack.attribute_hints` for extraction guidance
- Respects `output_schema` definitions for validation
- Applies domain-specific normalization rules
- Integrates with field mapping configurations

### Future T4+ Integration Ready
- Structured `ExtractionResult` format for storage systems
- Quality metrics for ML training data preparation
- Batch processing capabilities for large-scale operations
- Metadata tracking for audit and compliance

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: Configurable batch processing (1-10000 items)
- **Latency**: Async operations with configurable timeouts
- **Reliability**: Exponential backoff retry logic
- **Quality**: Multi-layer validation with confidence scoring
- **Cost**: MockLLMClient for development, production LLM usage tracking

## Next Steps

The T3 LLM Extraction Pipeline is now ready for:

1. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing with real domain packs
2. **Production Deployment**: OpenAI API key configuration and deployment
3. **T4 Storage Integration**: Connect to storage systems for result persistence
4. **Performance Optimization**: Batch processing tuning and caching strategies
5. **Additional LLM Providers**: Extend support for Anthropic, local models, etc.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for LLM-based attribute and term extraction while maintaining the modular, protocol-based architecture of the echo-roots framework.
